// Input: S1 = ABCD, S2 = CDAB
// Output: Strings are rotations of each other

// Input: S1 = ABCD, S2 = ACBD
// Output: Strings are not rotations of each other



// str1 = “ABACD”, str2 = “CDABA”
// temp = str1.str1 = “ABACDABACD”
// Since str2 is a substring of temp, str1 and str2 are rotations of each other.
